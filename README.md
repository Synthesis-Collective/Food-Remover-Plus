# **Still in development. Use at own risk.**
I got temporarily called back to RL abruptly before I could finalize this. It will hopefully be finished by end of April '23.

# FoodRemoverPlus
Improved version of FoodRemover, a Skyrim Mutagen Patcher that iterates through all placed food objects in a cell and randomly disables them based on location type. It now has UI based configuration as well as a number of new features including the ability to skip owned food, to set the ownership of all food (no more free food everywhere) and remove all alchemical food effects.
